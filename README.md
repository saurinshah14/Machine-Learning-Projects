# Machine-Learning-Projects
The power of theory is amplified through implementing projects. As I continue studying Machine Learning, I shall keep uploading projects implementing skills that I have learnt.

My first ever project of Machine Learning.
Predicting Housing Prices is a Linear Regression problem.
The project dataset consists of train and test data. The train data has 81 features including the Sale Price which is the dependent feature.

In this project, all important pipeline steps of building a model, right from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), to Feature Engineering and Feature Selection up to building
a suitable regressor model for fitting my train data and predicting the house price of the test data has been done. 

Under EDA, the NULL values, the redundant features, the categorical features including the rare categorical features have been handled using One Hot Encoding. 
Also the skew numerical features have been converted into features having values fitting the Standard Normal Gaussian Distribution. Feature Engineering and Feature Selection has been done accordingly on both
the train and test data. XGB Regressor model has been implemented to predict the Sale Price of the houses.
